<h2>About Us</h2>
<p>This site is created by 2 NUS students as part of their
Orbital project summer 2014. The aim is to help users easily
record down the memorable moments associated with the attached
photos so they can recall these moments when they look at the
photo in the future. Users can either share these moments with
their friends on Facebook or keep them as collection by
downloading the completed work as a PDF file.
